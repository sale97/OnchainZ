          <p>
            In this first course of the specialization, we will discuss the limitations of the Internet for business and
            economic activity, and explain how blockchain technology represents the way forward.
            <br><br>
            After completing this course, you will be able to explain what blockchain is, how it works, and why it is
            revolutionary. You will learn key concepts such as mining, hashing, proof-of-work, public key cryptography, and
            the double-spend problem. You’ll be able to describe seven design principles for blockchain technology, and the
            challenges facing the people developing it. You’ll also meet the players in the blockchain ecosystem, and
            consider your own role in stewarding the blockchain revolution.

            OnChainz course review:
          </h3>
    
          <p>
            The course starts with the basic concepts and functionalities of blockchains. Later the presented topics devote
            lots of attention to less technical but to more economic and social aspects of the "blockchain revolution".
            <br><br>
            The course is designed for beginners. We would advice to take it as a second course on blockchains because it
            does not explain thoroughly all the basic yet more technical concepts. In addition, the course covers lots of
            material, provide many external information sources that may be challenging to comprehend for the first-timers.
            <br><br>
            There are no prerequisites for the course but having a bit of exposure to blockchains would be helpful.

            Content ****
          </h3>
    
          <p>
            The topic discussions are structured as “technology part – implied economic/social changes”. For example, after
            the introduction of basic blockchain functionalities follows the chapter on blockchain implicit design
            principles like integrity, power distribution, privacy, inclusion, etc. Since it is an introductory course it
            touches many topics within the blockchain universe leaving learners to study/understand the details on their
            own.
          </p>
    
          <h3>
            Technology ***
          </h3>
    
          <p>
            In the first part of the course the very basic blockchain related concepts are discussed. Usually the technical
            parts in the video lectures tend to be more described than thoroughly explained. Many times a course instructor
            just reads the text in a video... The technical knowledge seekers are provided with the external reading/video
            information sources, that sometimes are neglected by learners.
          </p>
    
          <h3>
            Applications *****
          </h3>
    
          <p>
            The course targets beginners. However, we think the course would be most valuable to people who have already
            learned the very basic blockchain functionalities and now are seeking to better understand the scope of
            economic/social changes implied by the adoption of the blockchain innovation.
